# Memory

## `data`

Memory files must be named `memory.md`.

```bash
.memories/
└── data/                               # searchable memories
    ├── webassembly-compile-error/      # memory directory matches the memory's title
    │   └── memory.md                   # memory file
    └── opennext-cache-components/
        ├── memory.md
        ├── response.json               # unindexed attachment that the agent inspects once it retrieves the memory
        └── error.png                   # unindexed attachment
```

The names of the memory's parent directories act as searchable tags.

```bash
data/
├── errors/
│   └── webassembly-compile-error/
│       └── memory.md
├── gotchas/
│   └── cache/
│       └── opennext-cache-components/
│           └── memory.md
└── ADRs/
```

## Memory file

Frontmatter fields act as searchable tags.

```bash

### Fields

#### id

Required. Stable identifier for this memory. Don't change it. Used to track the memory across renames, and for upvotes when those are enabled.

#### created

Required. UTC calendar date when the memory was inserted (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Don't change it. Pruning uses this date for the unvoted lifetime.

#### title

Required. The memory title. Can be changed anytime.

#### doNotDelete

Optional. Defaults to `false`.

Set this to `true` if you prevent the agent from deleting this memory.

#### doNotEdit

Optional. Defaults to `false`.

Set this to `true` if you want to disallow the agent to edit it via MCP tools.

#### scope

Optional. **Scopes are literal paths relative to the git root, not globs.**

A missing frontmatter scope means the scope defaults to the parent of the `.memories` directory.

Example:

```yaml
scope:
  - apps/web
  - apps/api
```

This memory applies to the `web` and `api` directories and all files beneath them.

### Custom fields

Custom frontmatter fields act as searchable tags.

Example:

```bash
---
id: 7fe24e91-4808-4f80-bc39-5d86f7a74be0
created: 2026-09-19
title: Axios retry duplication after reconnect

anchors:
  - packages/api/src/websocket.ts
linear: https://linear.app/acme/issue/ACM-86/axios-reconnect-issue
retireWhen:
  condition: "Zero occurrences in Sentry for 60 days"
  links:

```

To use custom fields, define [a schema](./config.md#custom).
