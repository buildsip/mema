# CLI

`tiramisu` reads and writes Git-native memories. Agents run the same command.

Basic usage:

```bash filename="Terminal"
tiramisu [command] [options]
```

Running `tiramisu` with no command prints help.

Every invocation also refreshes [global MCP installation](../mcp/installation.md).

Requires Node.js `>=22.5.0`.

## Reference

| Options             | Description            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `-h` or `--help`    | Show help.             |
| `-V` or `--version` | Print the CLI version. |

### Commands

| Command                 | Description                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`init`](./init.md)     | Initialize a Git root, then the nearest package.        |
| [`mcp`](./mcp.md)       | Serve memory tools over stdio.                          |
| [`search`](./search.md) | Search titles, frontmatter, directory tags, and bodies. |
| [`insert`](./insert.md) | Create one memory from JSON.                            |
| [`update`](./update.md) | Patch one existing memory from JSON.                    |
| [`delete`](./delete.md) | Delete memories and their attachments by path.          |
| [`upvote`](./upvote.md) | Record human or agent upvotes.                          |
| [`prune`](./prune.md)   | List expired memory directories for review.             |

### `--roots`

Required on memory commands. [`init`](./init.md) and [`mcp`](./mcp.md) do not take this flag. Workspace directories. Repeat the flag or pass multiple paths.

```bash filename="Terminal"
tiramisu search --roots /workspace/app --roots /workspace/team --repo /workspace/app --query cache
```

Each path must be a directory. The CLI canonicalizes it with `realpath`. Duplicate roots are ignored.

### `--repo`

Required on memory commands. Git root of the workspace project the agent is working on.

`--repo` must be a directory, that Git root, and inside one of `--roots`. A package directory is rejected.

### `--input`

Optional on [`insert`](./insert.md) and [`update`](./update.md). Path to a JSON file. Omit it, or pass `-`, to read stdin.

Stdin must be piped. A TTY with no `--input` is an error.

JSON must be one object with double-quoted keys. Comments and trailing commas are rejected. A file path ignores stdin.

### Output

Successful `search`, `insert`, `update`, `delete`, `upvote`, and `prune` print JSON on stdout. MCP installation warnings, if any, are separate `{ "warning": "<instruction>" }` lines on stderr and do not fail the command.

Command failures print `{ "error": "<message>" }` on stderr, set exit code `1`, and print nothing on stdout. [`init`](./init.md) prints command errors through its interactive UI instead of JSON.

Help and version do not use this error format.

Symbolic links under a command's repo are rejected.
